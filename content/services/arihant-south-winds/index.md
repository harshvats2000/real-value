The concept evolves by conscious amalgamation of contemporary and ethnic architecture and there is a consistent flow of flora and fauna outside as well as inside the building premises by providing uninterrupted landscape green podium at first floor level. The magnificent triple heighted lobby with sprawling green cascade gives a warm and serene feel to the occupants. An exclusive lift takes you to the arravali sky lounge where one can relish the amazing view of surrounding arravali ranges. Another unique feature of the building complex is its hanging glass knife edge infinity swimming pool
